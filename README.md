## Project Goals

In this project, you’ll use your knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre. You’ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.

Using `fetch`, `async`, and `await`, you’ll request data from the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org) to create a movie discovery app.
